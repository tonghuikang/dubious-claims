# Personal Position
I do not endorse the States Times Review (STR). As much as I dislike their simplifying arguments and disregard for building a constructive conversation, their existence is inevitable in any society with free access to the Internet. As long as there is audience, there is definitely someone who is willing to write, for money or otherwise.

In an attempt to facilitate constructive discourse, I hope to emulate the way they write their articles. <BR>

[//]: # (In inverted commas is their representation of the establishment's stance)

## Notable articles
There are a few articles that STR wrote to defend its existence. <BR>

# STR's Common Terminologies and Stance

## Politics
### Overreach of Power
dictator Prime Minister <BR>
Lee Hsien Loong wanted to retain a position higher than the new Prime Minister so he could control the head of state like a puppet – like as his father did with former Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong. <BR>

### The office of President
The president takes direct instruction from Lee Hsien Loong as a puppet <BR>
President-select Halimah Yacob <BR>
Halimah Yacob denouncing her Indian heritage <BR>
Indian Muslims are Malays, Christian Malays are not Malays <BR>

### Censorship of the Criticisms
Criticisms of the husband and wife duo, Ho Ching and Lee Hsien Loong, of nepotism will result in defamation lawsuits. 
Several former civil servants and members of the ruling party elites like former LKY School dean Donald Low and Kishore Mahbubani, openly criticised the Lee Hsien Loong government. Both were then hit back by the new government and they have since been fired from their positions with the government university. <BR>
Political harassment is a common abuse practised by the Singapore dictatorship, and the authorities often intimidate by hauling them up for lengthy police interviews. <BR>
The Singapore government wants to ban dissent and criticisms <BR>
In fact, they actively send people to jail or make them bankrupts <BR>
keeping Singaporeans ignorant and incapable of critical thinking <BR>

### Press Controls
state media
the 151st-ranking propaganda media <BR>
propaganda ministry, Ministry of Communications and Information <BR>
state-controlled media Straits Times is a propaganda mule <BR>
Writers of independent news websites are usually dirt poor, and the website infrastructure are severely underfunded. <BR>


### Corruption
crony contractors whose directors are PAP grassroots leaders getting margin as high as 50% from government contracts <BR>
corrupted Prime Minister <BR>
police and judiciary are all corrupted <BR>

### Ministerial salaries
millionaire minister <BR>
million dollar salaries <BR>
S$1.5 million-a-year Halimah Yacob <BR>
“Million dollar ministerial salaries guarantees corruption-free” <BR>
legalised corruptions <BR>

### International Politics

## Economy
### Foreign Talent

preferential treatment of foreigners <BR>
Indian professionals has a poor international reputation due to the number of fake qualifications. <BR>

### Employment
MOM however employ dubious calculation methods <BR>
Singapore workers do not enjoy adequate employment rights due to government unions siding with employers <BR>
21.6% of the graduates were unable to find a full-time job in 2017 <BR>

### Income inequality
Singapore has one of the world’s highest income inequality. <BR>

### Taxes
“GST helps the poor” <BR>

## Living in Singapore
### Transport System
low-quality public transport delivering substandard services <BR>

### Elderly Care
elderly picking up cardboard and all other things <BR>
Many old people ended up working in demeaning jobs like cleaners and security guards, and those who cannot find employment ended up selling tissue paper and collecting trolleys of cardboard on the streets. <BR>
"old people who collect cardboard are not really financially well-off, and some simply took the demeaning work as an exercise" <BR>

### CPF
It is understood that CPF funds pay interest rates as low as 2.5% to CPF account holders while Temasek Holdings borrowed the funds at the same low-interest rates to invest in high returns and lucrative investments. Temasek Holdings will pocket the difference in profits and claimed to return the profits to the national reserve. Nobody knows the amount of national reserves Singapore have, not even the elected President. <BR>
The public is also worried about the high profile losses of Temasek Holdings and GIC, with many speculating that the government has run out of CPF funds. <BR>
The state of poverty among the elderly is largely due to the failure of the national retirement fund CPF. <BR>
Central Provident Provident (CPF), pays interest rates as low as 2.5% resulting in an accumulation rate slower than the rate of inflation every year <BR>

### HDB
The Singapore government dished out a convenient lie telling the elderly to sell their HDB flats to retire, and many listened to the good old PAP doctrine. The market eventually became oversupplied, and now many retirees found there is no buyer as everyone is doing the same thing. <BR>
